Phase 1 (bare necessities)
-------
- One type of component
- Each component is an independent leaf that specifies all parameters
- Users activate/deactivate individual feeds


Phase 2 (useful product)
-------
- User can activate/deactivate feeds individually or by groups
- Three types of components:
  - JVM (JMX URL)
  - MBean descriptor (object name and attribute)
  - Feed (JVM + MBean descriptor)
- Adjustable feed rates
- Non-numerical feeds


Phase 3 (enterprise-ready)
-------
- User can build complex trees of operations that use feeds as inputs
- Feed collector is separate from MCT
  - usable by multiple instances
  - can run even if MCT is not
- Feed data is cached locally
- Feed collector can be controlled via MCT
- Detect duplicate components
- Permissions
